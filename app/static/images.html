                            This app deploys a Logistic Regression model to predict drug use. 
                            It was created with the <a href="http://www.monitoringthefuture.org/"> Monitoring the Future</a> dataset, a study funded by the 
                            Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) to study trends in teenage use and attitudes
                            towards drugs.

                            Every year, approximately 11,000-16,000 students across over 100 schools in the United States are given a survey
                            that asks questions about their past drug use, opinions on the risks of drugs, and general demographic information.
                            
                            The raw information (which can be found <a href="https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/NAHDAP/studies/6716#">HERE</a>) has been converted into a usable dataset which can be found on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/jamiedowat/monitoring-the-future-12th-grade-drug-use-survey">Kaggle</a>.

                            <p>This model is going to perform a fancy linear transformation on the data you enter into this survey, to try to guess whether or not you have used 
                                any illicit drugs (including marijuana) within the past year.</p>
                            <p>This model was only trained on high school seniors, so if you wanna give the model it's best shot at guessing right, fill out the survey as your 12th grade self!</p>
